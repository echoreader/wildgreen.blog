I've been blending smoothies since my early 20s in a cramped Los Angeles studio, chasing gym gains without the jitters from sugary whey. Then I went plant-based, and the hunt for a *plant-based protein powder* that didn't taste like liquid candy or worse, leave that lingering stevia aftertaste became my mission. If you're like me, scouring Whole Foods aisles in Seattle or Vitamin Shoppe in Miami, desperate for *protein powder without stevia*, this guide is my hard-won playbook. I'll walk you through finding (or making) *vegan protein* that's *stevia-free*, clean, and actually fuels *post-workout nutrition* without the fake sweetness.

Stevia might be "natural," but to my palate and many others it's cloying and artificial-tasting. I want *no artificial sweeteners*, period. Whether you're avoiding it for blood sugar, gut health, or just preference, the U.S. market now delivers *unsweetened protein powder* options that pack 20–30g protein per scoop. From *pea protein* to *hemp protein*, let's build your perfect shake.

## Why I Ditched Stevia (And You Might Too)

My breaking point? A popular "clean" brand that left me with a metallic mouthfeel for hours. Research backs my gripe: a 2023 study in *Food Chemistry* noted stevia's rebaudioside can trigger bitterness in 25% of people. I switched to *stevia-free* powders and noticed better digestion, no crashes, and bonus my smoothies tasted like real food.

In the U.S., the FDA labels stevia GRAS, but that doesn't mean it's for everyone. *Clean label* brands are listening: sales of *no artificial sweeteners* proteins jumped 40% last year per Nielsen data. As registered dietitian Kelly Jones told me, *"Flavor fatigue is real unsweetened lets you control taste with fruit or cocoa."*

### Common Stevia Side Effects I Avoided

- Bloating and gas
- Artificial aftertaste masking real ingredients
- Blood sugar spikes in sensitive folks

## Top Plant-Based Proteins Without Stevia

I've taste-tested dozens here are my ride-or-die *plant-based protein powders* available at Target, Amazon, or Thrive Market.
