## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What criteria are used to determine World Tourism Rankings?</summary>
  <p>The rankings typically rely on two main metrics published by organizations like the UNWTO (World Tourism Organization): **1) Total International Tourist Arrivals** (the volume of visitors) and **2) Total International Tourism Receipts** (the amount of revenue generated by those visitors).</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which countries traditionally rank highest in terms of tourist arrivals?</summary>
  <p>Countries in Europe and North America with well-established tourism infrastructure historically dominate arrival numbers. Nations like **France, Spain, the United States, and China** often occupy the top spots due to their iconic landmarks and cultural diversity.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is ranking high in arrivals always a positive sign for a country?</summary>
  <p>Not always. High arrival numbers can lead to **overtourism**, which strains local infrastructure, increases costs for residents, and degrades natural or historical sites. Many countries now focus on increasing **receipts (revenue) per visitor** rather than sheer volume.</p> 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does sustainability affect a country's long-term tourism ranking?</summary>
  <p>Sustainability is increasingly vital. Countries that invest in **eco-tourism**, cultural preservation, and manage waste effectively are seen as more attractive long-term destinations. Sustainable practices ensure the quality of the destination remains high, which guarantees continued visitor interest.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between International Tourist Arrivals and Receipts?</summary>
  <p>**Arrivals** measure the number of unique visitors crossing the border. **Receipts** measure the amount of money spent by those visitors on lodging, food, transport, and attractions. A country can have fewer arrivals but higher receipts if it attracts wealthy tourists who spend more per trip.</p>
